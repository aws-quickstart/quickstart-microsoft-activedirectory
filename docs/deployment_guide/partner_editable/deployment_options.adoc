This solution provides six deployment options (three scenarios with two options each):

*Scenario 1:*

* https://fwd.aws/EdwmE[Deploy and manage your own AD DS installation in a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/eKBrm[Deploy and manage your own AD DS installation in an existing VPC^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

*Scenario 2:*

* https://fwd.aws/AEBD7[Extend your on-premises AD into a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys two Windows EC2 instances into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/KGgYW[Extend your on-premises AD into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions two Windows EC2 instances in your existing AWS infrastructure.

*Scenario 3:*

* https://fwd.aws/EqwrE[Deploy AD DS with AWS Directory Service on AWS in a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys AWS Managed Microsoft AD into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/RgvXr[Deploy AD DS with AWS Directory Service on AWS in an existing VPC^]. This option provisions AWS Managed Microsoft AD in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The solution provides separate templates for these options. You can configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.

NOTE: AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Directory Service are available only in the AWS Regions listed in the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/asm.html[AWS Secrets Manager endpoints and quotas^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/regions.html[Region availability for AWS Directory Service^]. If you're deploying **scenario 1** (deploy and manage your own AD DS) or **scenario 3** (deploy AD DS with AWS Directory Service)—as described in the link:#_architecture[Architecture] section of this guide—check service availability before you choose the Region to deploy the solution into. Otherwise, your deployment will fail.
